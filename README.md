# SBL Handbook Second Edition Style for Wheaton PhDs

This is just the regular SBL style (full note) with some slight changes.

1. No DOI in the footnotes. That was just my own judgement and I didn't want to delete automatically imported data from Zotero.
2. Journal citation should be "41 no. 1" not "41.1" in the Wheaton style in both the footnotes and the bibliography.

To add to Zotero:

1. `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `Cite` -> `+` (the plus button is to the right under the list of styles)
2. Find the file I've attached and add. Zotero told me it's not valid but I think the regular SBL style is not valid and it just works.
3. Choose this style in your documents.
